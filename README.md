# midi-forth

A Forth-like interpreter with MIDI capabilities for generating and transforming MIDI sequences.

## Building

```bash
make              # Build everything
make test         # Run tests
make clean        # Remove build directory
```

Requires GCC/Clang and CMake 3.16+. First build compiles libremidi automatically.

## Running

```bash
./build/midi_forth      # Start MIDI Forth REPL
```

Type `help` for commands, `quit` to exit.

## Quick Start

```forth
midi-virtual            \ Create virtual MIDI port
500 dur!                \ Set note duration to 500ms
c4, e4, g4,             \ Play C, E, G
(c4 e4 g4),             \ Play C major chord
midi-close
```

---

## Concise Notation

The primary way to play notes. Use pitch names with octave numbers, trigger with comma.

### Single Notes

```forth
c4,                     \ Play middle C with defaults
c#4, db4,               \ Sharps and flats
60,                     \ MIDI note number works too
```

### Default Parameters

```forth
2 ch!                   \ Set default channel (1-16)
100 vel!                \ Set default velocity (0-127)
250 dur!                \ Set default duration in ms
```

### Explicit Parameters

```forth
1 c4 100 500,           \ ch pitch vel dur - play C4 on ch1, vel 100, 500ms
```

### Chords

```forth
(c4 e4 g4),             \ Play notes simultaneously
(c4 e4 g4) 1 80 500,    \ Chord with explicit ch, vel, dur
```

### Rests

```forth
r,                      \ Rest for default duration
r 1000,                 \ Rest for 1000ms
```

---

## Dynamics

Set velocity with dynamic markings:

```forth
ppp                     \ velocity 16
pp                      \ velocity 32
p                       \ velocity 48
mp                      \ velocity 64
mf                      \ velocity 80 (default)
f                       \ velocity 96
ff                      \ velocity 112
fff                     \ velocity 127

mf c4, ff g4,           \ Change dynamics inline
```

---

## Articulation

Add suffixes to pitch names:

```forth
c4.,                    \ Staccato - 50% duration
c4>,                    \ Accent - +20 velocity
c4-,                    \ Tenuto - full duration
```

---

## Relative Intervals

Move relative to last played pitch:

```forth
c4, +2, +2, +1,         \ Plays C D E F (up by semitones)
g4, -2, -2, -1,         \ Plays G F E D (down by semitones)
c4, ^,                  \ C4 then C5 (octave up)
c4, v,                  \ C4 then C3 (octave down)
```

---

## Alternatives and Probability

### Random Selection

```forth
c4|e4|g4,               \ Randomly play one of C, E, or G
c4|r,                   \ 50% note, 50% silence
```

### Probability

```forth
c4 75%,                 \ 75% chance to play, 25% silent
```

---

## Word Definitions

Define reusable patterns:

```forth
: melody c4, e4, g4, ;  \ Define a word
melody                  \ Execute it
melody 4 times          \ Execute 4 times total
```

---

## Anonymous Blocks

```forth
{ c4, e4, g4, } 4 *     \ Execute block 4 times
```

---

## Conditionals

```forth
1 if c4, then                       \ Play if true (non-zero)
0 if c4, else e4, then              \ Play else branch if false

random 50 > if c4, else e4, then    \ Random choice
```

---

## File Operations

### Load

```forth
load mysong.4th         \ Load and execute a file
```

### Record Commands

```forth
rec                     \ Start recording input
: melody c4, e4, g4, ;
melody
stop                    \ Stop recording
save mysong.4th         \ Save to file
```

### Capture MIDI

Record actual MIDI output with timing:

```forth

```

The saved file contains sequence commands that can be loaded and replayed:

```forth
load melody.4th         \ Load the captured sequence
midi-virtual
seq-play                \ Play it back
midi-close
```
