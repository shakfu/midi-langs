# midi-forth

A Forth-like interpreter with MIDI capabilities for generating and transforming MIDI sequences.

## Building

```bash
make              # Build both interpreters
make midi_forth   # Build MIDI interpreter only
make clean        # Remove binaries and build artifacts
```

Requires GCC/Clang and CMake 3.22+. First build compiles libremidi automatically.

## Running

```bash
./midi_forth      # Start MIDI Forth REPL
```

Type `help` for commands, `quit` to exit.

## Architecture

- **midi_forth.c** (~1300 lines)
  - Layer 1: libremidi C API integration
  - Layer 2: 32-bit packed note format
  - Layer 3: Array-based sequence storage (256 events/seq, 64 sequences)
  - Layer 4: Pattern DSL (note names, durations, chord builders)

- **Dependencies**: libremidi v5.3.1 (auto-built from `thirdparty/libremidi/`)
