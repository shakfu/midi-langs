# Alda Language Reference

This document covers the Alda language features implemented in alda-midi.

For comprehensive Alda documentation, see the [alda-language](alda-language/) directory.

## Notes

Notes are specified by letter name (a-g), optional accidental, and optional duration.

```alda
c d e f g a b      # Natural notes in current octave
```

### Accidentals

```alda
c# d# f# g# a#     # Sharps (also: cs ds fs gs as)
db eb gb ab bb     # Flats
c## d##            # Double sharps
dbb ebb            # Double flats
c_                 # Natural (explicit)
```

### Durations

Durations are specified as note values (denominators):

| Value | Name | Ticks |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 1 | Whole note | 1920 |
| 2 | Half note | 960 |
| 4 | Quarter note | 480 |
| 8 | Eighth note | 240 |
| 16 | Sixteenth note | 120 |
| 32 | Thirty-second | 60 |

```alda
c4                 # Quarter note
c8                 # Eighth note
c16                # Sixteenth note
c2                 # Half note
c1                 # Whole note
```

### Dotted Notes

Dots extend the duration by half:

```alda
c4.                # Dotted quarter (480 + 240 = 720 ticks)
c4..               # Double-dotted quarter (480 + 240 + 120 = 840 ticks)
c2.                # Dotted half
```

### Tied Notes

Ties connect two notes of the same pitch:

```alda
c4~4               # Quarter tied to quarter (held for 2 beats)
c2~8               # Half tied to eighth
c1~1               # Two whole notes tied
```

### Default Duration

If no duration is specified, the previous duration is used:

```alda
c4 d e f           # All quarter notes
c8 d e f g a b c   # All eighth notes
```

---

## Rests

Rests indicate silence:

```alda
r4                 # Quarter rest
r8                 # Eighth rest
r2.                # Dotted half rest
r1                 # Whole rest
```

---

## Octaves

### Setting Octave

```alda
o4 c d e           # Set octave to 4 (middle C = c in octave 4)
o5 c               # Octave 5
o3 c               # Octave 3
```

### Octave Shifts

```alda
> c                # Shift up one octave, then play c
< c                # Shift down one octave, then play c
>> c               # Shift up two octaves
```

### Octave Range

Octaves range from 0 to 9. Middle C (MIDI note 60) is `o4 c` or `c4` in octave 4.

| Octave | C MIDI Number |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 0 | 12 |
| 1 | 24 |
| 2 | 36 |
| 3 | 48 |
| 4 | 60 (Middle C) |
| 5 | 72 |
| 6 | 84 |
| 7 | 96 |
| 8 | 108 |

---

## Chords

Chords are simultaneous notes separated by `/`:

```alda
c/e/g              # C major triad
c/e/g/b            # C major 7th
c4/e/g             # Quarter note chord
d/f#/a             # D major
```

All notes in a chord share the same duration and start time.

---

## Parts (Instruments)

Parts declare which instrument plays the following events.

### Basic Part Declaration

```alda
piano:
  c d e f g

violin:
  c d e f g
```

### Part Groups

Apply events to multiple parts:

```alda
piano/violin:
  c d e f g        # Both instruments play the same notes
```

## Attributes

Attributes modify playback characteristics using S-expression syntax.

### Tempo

```alda
(tempo 120)        # Set tempo to 120 BPM
(tempo 60)         # Slower
(tempo 180)        # Faster
```

### Volume

```alda
(volume 100)       # Full volume (0-100)
(volume 50)        # Half volume
(vol 80)           # Shorthand
```

### Dynamics

Dynamics set velocity/volume using musical terms:

```alda
(ppp)              # Pianississimo (very very soft)
(pp)               # Pianissimo (very soft)
(p)                # Piano (soft)
(mp)               # Mezzo-piano (moderately soft)
(mf)               # Mezzo-forte (moderately loud)
(f)                # Forte (loud)
(ff)               # Fortissimo (very loud)
(fff)              # Fortississimo (very very loud)
```

### Quantization

Quantization controls note articulation (percentage of duration actually sounded):

```alda
(quant 100)        # Legato (full duration)
(quant 90)         # Default (slightly detached)
(quant 50)         # Staccato (half duration)
(quantization 80)  # Full name
```

### Panning

```alda
(panning 0)        # Hard left
(panning 64)       # Center (default)
(panning 127)      # Hard right
(pan 32)           # Left of center
```

---

## Voices

Voices enable polyphonic writing within a single part.

### Basic Voices

```alda
piano:
  V1: c1 d e f     # Voice 1
  V2: e1 f g a     # Voice 2 (plays simultaneously)
```

### Voice Merging

`V0:` merges all voices, continuing from the latest position:

```alda
piano:
  V1: c4 d e f     # 4 quarter notes
  V2: c2 d         # 2 half notes (same total duration)
  V0: c1           # Continues after both voices finish
```

### Voice Numbers

Voices are numbered 1-8. Each voice has independent timing within the part.

---

## Repeats

Repeat sections of music:

```alda
[ c d e f ] * 4    # Repeat 4 times
c d e f * 2        # Repeat just the last note
```

---

## Barlines

Barlines are optional and ignored (for readability only):

```alda
c4 d e f | g a b c | d1
```

---

## Comments

```alda
# This is a comment
c d e f    # Inline comment
```

---

## MIDI Channel Assignment

Channels are automatically assigned to parts in declaration order:

| Order | Channel |
| ----- | ------- |
| 1st part | Channel 1 |
| 2nd part | Channel 2 |
| ... | ... |
| 9th part | Channel 9 |
| 10th part | Channel 11 (skip 10) |
| ... | ... |

Channel 10 is reserved for percussion in General MIDI.
