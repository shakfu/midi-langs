## MidiPerform Module

```haskell
import MidiPerform
```

Immediate MIDI playback with generative functions. All functions are IO actions.

### MIDI Control

```haskell
open     :: IO ()  -- open virtual port "mhsMIDI"
openPort :: Int -> IO ()  -- open hardware port by index
close    :: IO ()  -- close MIDI port
panic    :: IO ()  -- all notes off
ports    :: IO ()  -- list available ports
```

### Note Playing

```haskell
note :: Pitch -> IO ()
-- Play note with defaults (channel 1, mf, quarter)

noteWith :: Channel -> Velocity -> Duration -> Pitch -> IO ()
-- Play note with explicit parameters

chord :: [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Play chord with defaults

chordWith :: Channel -> Velocity -> Duration -> [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Play chord with explicit parameters

arpeggio :: [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Arpeggiate with defaults (mf, sixteenth)

arpeggioWith :: Channel -> Velocity -> Duration -> [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Arpeggiate with explicit parameters
```

### Timing

```haskell
rest :: Duration -> IO ()
wait :: Duration -> IO ()  -- alias for rest
```

### Sequences

```haskell
melody :: [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Play melody with defaults (mf, quarter)

melodyWith :: Channel -> Velocity -> Duration -> [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Play melody with explicit parameters

times :: Int -> IO () -> IO ()
-- Repeat an action n times
```

### Generative Functions

```haskell
seed :: Int -> IO ()
-- Seed random number generator

pick :: [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Play random note from list

chance :: Int -> IO () -> IO ()
-- Execute action with probability (0-100)

oneOf :: [IO ()] -> IO ()
-- Execute one random action from list

maybeDo :: IO () -> IO ()
-- 50% chance to execute

scramble :: [Pitch] -> IO ()
-- Play notes in random order

randomNote :: Pitch -> Pitch -> IO ()
-- Play random note in range

randomMelody :: Int -> Pitch -> Pitch -> IO ()
-- Play n random notes in range

walk :: Int -> Pitch -> Int -> IO ()
-- Random walk: n notes, starting pitch, max step size

drunk :: Int -> Pitch -> [Pitch] -> Int -> IO ()
-- Drunk walk constrained to scale: n notes, start, scale, max degrees

euclidean :: Int -> Int -> IO () -> IO ()
-- Euclidean rhythm: hits, steps, action
```

### Scales (for Generative Use)

```haskell
major :: Pitch -> [Pitch]
minor :: Pitch -> [Pitch]
pentatonic :: Pitch -> [Pitch]
blues :: Pitch -> [Pitch]
chromatic :: Pitch -> [Pitch]
dorian :: Pitch -> [Pitch]
phrygian :: Pitch -> [Pitch]

### Low-level MIDI

```haskell
noteOn :: Channel -> Pitch -> Velocity -> IO ()
noteOff :: Channel -> Pitch -> IO ()
cc :: Channel -> Int -> Int -> IO ()
program :: Channel -> Int -> IO ()
bend :: Channel -> Int -> IO ()
```

### Constants

Pitches, durations, and velocities are the same as in Music.hs.

## MusicPerform Module

```haskell
import MusicPerform
```

Re-exports Music and Midi, adds `perform` to bridge pure Music to MIDI.

### Performance

```haskell
perform :: Music -> IO ()
-- Perform music on channel 1

performOn :: Channel -> Music -> IO ()
-- Perform music on specific channel
```

### Microtonal

```haskell
centsToBend :: Int -> IO Int
-- Convert cents to pitch bend value

pitchBendCents :: Channel -> Int -> IO ()
-- Send pitch bend in cents
```

---

## Music Module (Pure)

```haskell
import Music
```

Pure music theory with no IO. All functions are pure.

### Types

```haskell
type Pitch = Int      -- MIDI note number (0-127)
type Duration = Int   -- milliseconds
type Velocity = Int   -- 0-127
type Channel = Int    -- 1-16

data Event
    = ENote Pitch Velocity Duration
    | ERest Duration

data Music
    = MEvent Event
    | MSeq [Music]    -- sequential
    | MPar [Music]    -- parallel
```

### Constructors

```haskell

-- Single note

rest :: Duration -> Music
-- Rest (silence)

chord :: [Pitch] -> Velocity -> Duration -> Music

-- Check if pitch belongs to scale

quantize :: Pitch -> Pitch -> Scale -> Pitch
-- Snap pitch to nearest scale tone
```

### Pure Generative Functions

Music.hs includes pure generative algorithms that work with explicit seeds for reproducibility.

#### Pure PRNG

```haskell
type Seed = Int

nextRandom :: Seed -> (Int, Seed)
-- Linear Congruential Generator, returns (value, nextSeed)

randomRange :: Seed -> Int -> Int -> (Int, Seed)
-- Random Int in range [lo, hi]

randomList :: Seed -> Int -> Int -> Int -> ([Int], Seed)
-- Generate n random Ints in range [lo, hi]
```

#### Deterministic Algorithms

```haskell
euclideanRhythm :: Int -> Int -> [Bool]
-- Bjorklund algorithm: euclideanRhythm 3 8 = [T,F,F,T,F,F,T,F]

arpUp :: [a] -> [a]
-- Ascending pattern (identity)

arpDown :: [a] -> [a]
-- Descending pattern (reverse)

arpUpDown :: [a] -> [a]
-- Up-down pattern (no repeated top)

retrograde :: Music -> Music
-- Reverse music in time

invert :: Pitch -> Music -> Music
-- Melodic inversion around axis pitch
```

#### Seed-based Random

```haskell
shuffle :: Seed -> [a] -> [a]
-- Fisher-Yates shuffle

pick :: Seed -> [a] -> a
-- Pick one element

pickN :: Seed -> Int -> [a] -> [a]
-- Pick n elements (with replacement)

randomWalk :: Seed -> Pitch -> Int -> Int -> [Pitch]
-- Random walk: seed, start, maxStep, count

drunkWalk :: Seed -> Pitch -> [Pitch] -> Int -> Int -> [Pitch]
-- Scale-constrained walk: seed, start, scale, maxDegrees, count
```

### Microtonal Scale Constants

Cents-based scales for quarter-tones:

`scaleMaqamBayatiCents`, `scaleMaqamRastCents`, `scaleMaqamSabaCents`, `scaleMakamUssakCents`, `scaleShrutiCents`, etc.

```haskell
centsToNote :: Pitch -> Int -> (Pitch, Int)
-- Convert cents interval to (MIDI note, bend cents)
```

---

## Midi Module (FFI)

```haskell
import Midi
```

Low-level FFI bindings. Most users should use MidiPerform or MusicPerform instead.

### Port Management

```haskell
midiInit :: IO Bool
midiCleanup :: IO ()
midiListPorts :: IO Int
midiPortName :: Int -> IO String
midiOpen :: Int -> IO Bool
midiOpenVirtual :: String -> IO Bool
midiClose :: IO ()
midiIsOpen :: IO Bool
```

### MIDI Messages

```haskell
midiNoteOn :: Int -> Int -> Int -> IO ()
midiNoteOff :: Int -> Int -> IO ()
midiCC :: Int -> Int -> Int -> IO ()
midiProgram :: Int -> Int -> IO ()
midiPitchBend :: Int -> Int -> IO ()
midiSend :: Int -> Int -> Int -> IO ()
```

### Utilities

```haskell
midiSleep :: Int -> IO ()
midiPanic :: IO ()
midiCentsToBend :: Int -> IO Int
```

### Random

```haskell
midiSeedRandom :: Int -> IO ()
midiRandom :: IO Int
midiRandomRange :: Int -> Int -> IO Int
```

### MIDI Recording

Record MIDI events for replay or export. Records note-on, note-off, and CC events with timestamps.

```haskell
midiRecordStart :: Int -> IO Bool
-- Start recording at given BPM

midiRecordStop :: IO Int
-- Stop recording, returns event count

midiRecordSave :: String -> IO Bool
-- Save recorded events to Haskell replay module

midiRecordCount :: IO Int
-- Get current event count

midiRecordActive :: IO Bool
-- Check if recording is active
```

#### Recording Example

```haskell
import Midi
import MidiPerform

main :: IO ()
main = do
    _ <- midiOpenVirtual "MhsMidi"
    _ <- midiRecordStart 120

    note c4
    note e4
    chord (major g4)

    _ <- midiRecordStop
    _ <- midiRecordSave "melody.hs"

    midiClose
```

The generated file contains:
- Event data as a Haskell list of tuples
- A `replay` function that recreates the performance
