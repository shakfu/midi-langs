# mhs-midi

A Haskell MIDI library for MicroHs, providing both pure functional composition and immediate MIDI playback with generative music functions.

## Features

- **Pure Music DSL**: Compose and transform music functionally before performance
- **Immediate Playback**: Direct MIDI output for REPL-style interaction
- **Generative Music**: Random selection, walks, euclidean rhythms, probability
- **55 Built-in Scales**: Modes, pentatonics, world scales, ragas, maqamat
- **Microtonal Support**: 10 cents-based scales with quarter-tones
- **Interactive REPL**: Fast startup with caching

## Module Structure

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Music.hs` | Pure music theory + DSL (no IO) |
| `Midi.hs` | FFI bindings |
| `MusicPerform.hs` | `perform` bridge for pure Music |
| `MidiPerform.hs` | Immediate IO + generative functions |

## Quick Start

### 1. Build

```bash
make
```

### 2. Start the REPL

```bash
./scripts/mhs-midi-repl
```

### 3. Immediate Playback (MidiPerform)

```haskell
> import MidiPerform
> open
MIDI open
> note c4
> chord [c4, e4, g4]
> melody [c4, d4, e4, f4, g4]
> drunk 16 c4 (major c4) 2    -- generative walk
> close
```

### 4. Pure Composition (MusicPerform)

```haskell
> import MusicPerform
> midiOpenVirtual "test"
> let m = line [c4, e4, g4] mf quarter
> perform m
> perform (transpose 7 m)
> midiClose
```

## Two Approaches

### MidiPerform - Immediate IO

For REPL interaction and generative music. Musical terms are IO actions:

```haskell
import MidiPerform

main = do
    open
    note c4                           -- play immediately
    chord [c4, e4, g4]                -- play chord
    times 4 (pick (pentatonic c4))    -- random notes
    drunk 16 c4 (major c4) 2          -- drunk walk
    euclidean 5 8 (note c4)           -- euclidean rhythm
    close
```

### MusicPerform - Pure Composition

For composing music as pure data, then performing:

```haskell
import MusicPerform

melody = line [c4, e4, g4] mf quarter
piece = melody +:+ transpose 7 melody

main = do
    midiOpenVirtual "MyApp"
    perform piece
    perform (louder 20 (stretch 2 piece))
    midiClose
```

## Generative Functions (MidiPerform)

### Random Selection

```haskell
pick [c4, e4, g4]           -- random note from list
chance 75 (note c4)         -- 75% probability
oneOf [note c4, chord [c4, e4, g4]]  -- random action
maybeDo (note c4)           -- 50% chance
```

### Random Sequences

```haskell
scramble [c4, e4, g4, c5]   -- random order
randomNote c4 c5            -- random pitch in range
randomMelody 8 c4 c5        -- 8 random notes
```

### Algorithmic Patterns

```haskell
walk 16 c4 3                -- random walk, max 3 semitone steps
drunk 16 c4 (major c4) 2    -- walk constrained to scale
euclidean 5 8 (note c4)     -- 5 hits over 8 steps
```

### Scales for Generative Use

```haskell
major c4        -- C major scale (multiple octaves)
minor a4        -- A minor
pentatonic c4   -- pentatonic
blues c4        -- blues
dorian d4       -- dorian mode
```

## Pure Music DSL (Music.hs)

### Constructors

```haskell
note :: Pitch -> Velocity -> Duration -> Music
rest :: Duration -> Music
chord :: [Pitch] -> Velocity -> Duration -> Music
line :: [Pitch] -> Velocity -> Duration -> Music
```

### Pure Generative Functions

```haskell
-- Deterministic algorithms
euclideanRhythm 3 8         -- [T,F,F,T,F,F,T,F]
arpUp, arpDown, arpUpDown   -- arpeggio patterns
retrograde                   -- reverse in time
invert c4                    -- melodic inversion

-- Seed-based random (reproducible)
shuffle 42 [c4,e4,g4]       -- same seed = same result
randomWalk 42 c4 3 16       -- seed, start, maxStep, count
drunkWalk 42 c4 scale 2 16  -- constrained to scale
```

### Combinators

```haskell
(+:+) :: Music -> Music -> Music   -- sequential
(|||) :: Music -> Music -> Music   -- parallel
timesM :: Int -> Music -> Music    -- repeat
```

### Transformations

```haskell
transpose :: Int -> Music -> Music
louder :: Int -> Music -> Music
softer :: Int -> Music -> Music
stretch :: Int -> Music -> Music   -- 2 = twice as slow
compress :: Int -> Music -> Music  -- 2 = twice as fast
```

### Example

```haskell
import MusicPerform

melody = line [c4, e4, g4] mf quarter
bass = line [c3, g3] ff half
piece = melody ||| bass                    -- parallel
full = piece +:+ transpose 5 piece         -- sequential

main = do
    midiOpenVirtual "Composition"
    perform full
    perform (stretch 2 (softer 20 full))   -- slow and quiet
    midiClose
```
